  <p>Hi! I'm Matt, I moved to SF over 3 1/2 years ago from Chicago! I have fallen in love with the BayArea and fondly consider it home now, although I still miss Chicago (and my family!).</p>
</div>

<div>
  <p> I graduted from Marquette University in 2008 (#mubb), where I studied economics. My first job after graduation was an internship based in London. There I worked for a software company who provided a platform to the maritime trade industry. Through this job, I got my first exposure to software development.</P>
</div>

<div>
  <p>Following my time in London, I returned back to Chicago and transitioned to working for CCS Fundraising, a company that I previously did an internship with. They are a consulting firm, helping non-profits manage large-scale fundrasing campaigns. Most recently, I worked for Blu Homes, a company that sells and deliveries high-end, eco-friendly, modular homes. I directly supprot sales reprsentations on pre-sales deals and worked with clients on the decision making process and overall management of their projects.</p>
</div>

<div>
<p>I'm a big sports fan, especially basketball (Bulls, Marquette, USA Basketball)! An aspiring photographer <a href="http://instagram.com/MatthewP_M">INSTAGRAM</a>, traveller, British Accent Connoisseur, and natrually curious person! I cannot wait to continue learning about web development and technologies!</p> 
</div>

  <h3>Cheers, Matt</h3>
